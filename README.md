# Real-time Ray Tracing with `nannou` & `rust-gpu`

An attempt at a real-time implementation of "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by
Peter Shirley. This was a personal experiment to learn more about rust-gpu,
ray tracing, and what limitations there are around ray tracing in real-time.

## Performance

A small GUI was developed to tweak the most performance intensive parameters to
better understand what affects performance. E.g. on my XPS 13 with integrated
GPU the render above was taken with 20 rays per pixel and runs at around 3 FPS,
however running the same scene with 2 rays per pixel yields ~25 FPS but with a
much noisier result.

## Build Requirements

- Use `rustup` to install nightly Rust and include the `llvm-tools-preview`,
  `rustc-dev` and `rust-src` components. These are necessary for the rust-gpu
  spir-v builder to function.
- `nannou` is used to provide the event loop, wgpu graphics pipeline and a small
  GUI for tweaking performance. Take a look at the platform-specific
  requirements for nannou projects [here](https://guide.nannou.cc/getting_started/platform-specific_setup.html).

## Running

To run the project, use:

```
cargo run --release -p nannou-raytracer-app
```

## Code Structure

There are 3 crates in this repo:

- `app` is the main application that provides the GUI, builds the Rust shader
  via `SpirvBuilder` and sets up the WGPU pipeline.
- `shader` is the crate containing both the fragment shader and vertex shader
  entrypoints (`main_fs` and `main_vs`).
- `shared` contains code shared between both `app` and `shader`. It declares
  and implements most of the ray-tracing abstractions and logic. By implementing
  most stuff in a shared crate, I could more easily debug certain functions on
  the CPU in the `app` if necessary.

## rust-gpu

`rust-gpu` is still very rough around the edges but is already approaching a
dream-come-true.

Being able to share code between the CPU and GPU was especially helpful for
debugging. I had a few bugs (poor RNG, tracing an infinite loop, etc) that would
normally be a nightmare to debug in a shader, however in this case I could just
call the same function on the CPU, add some `dbg!`s and work out what the
issue was in no time.

I especially look forward to support for ADTs (enums with data) as this would
make looping over `Material`s and `Hittable` objects much easier (the current
workaround uses IDs and indices in a rather hacky manner). Support for trait
objects would be equally nice, though it looks like this would require changes
to the Vulkan specification itself.
